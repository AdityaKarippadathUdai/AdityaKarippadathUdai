# 👋 Hi, I'm Aditya K U

🎓 B.Tech in Computer Science (AI) @ Amrita University, Amaravati  
🧠 AI & Software Enthusiast | Systems Thinker  
⚽ Sports Lover | 📚 Reader  

I enjoy building intelligent systems that extract meaning from text, reason over evidence, and generate balanced outputs.  
Currently focused on Software, RAG systems, and efficient LLM deployment.

# 🚀 Featured Project

## 🧠 Debate-Based NLP Chatbot

A modular, claim-first NLP system that:
- Extracts key claims from input text
- Simplifies each claim using FLAN-T5
- Detects debatability
- Retrieves supporting & opposing evidence
- Generates counterarguments
- Produces balanced synthesized output

### 🏗 Architecture Modules
1. Claim Extraction  
2. Claim-wise Text Simplification (google/flan-t5-small)  
3. Debatability Detection  
4. Evidence Retrieval (Web + Vector Search)  
5. Counterargument Generation  
6. Balanced Output Synthesis  
7. Gradio-based UI Interface  

### 🛠 Tech Used
- Hugging Face Transformers  
- PyTorch  
- SpaCy (NER)  
- Wikipedia API  
- RAG Architecture  
- Gradio  
- Linux
